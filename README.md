# OwnAi

Own AI is a set of docker containers that allow you to host your own AI.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Nvidia GPU (AMD will work with some tinkering, see ROCM versions of images)
- Enough VRAM to run the models

Note:
Watchtower is not require but nice to have, auto updates containers by checking for new releases.
